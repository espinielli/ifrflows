# ifrflows

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ifrflows is to create the data flows data for IFR flights for the EUROCONTROL area.
It is used both for the Studies ([Intra](https://ansperformance.eu/study/flows-intra/) and
[Extra](https://ansperformance.eu/study/flows-extra/) European Flight Flows) in the 
[AIU Portal](https://ansperformance.eu/) but also in a [prototype](fmb) using 
[Flowmap.blue](https://flowmap.blue/)
