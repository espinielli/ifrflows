  abstract = {Widely available data on the number of people living outside of their country of birth do not adequately
capture contemporary intensities and patterns of global migration flows. We present data on bilateral flows
between 196 countries from 1990 through 2010 that
provide a comprehensive view of international
migration flows. Our data suggest a s
table intensity of global 5-year migration flows at \textasciitilde{}0.6\% of world
population since 1995. In addition, the results aid the interpretation of trends and patterns of migration
flows to and from individual countries by placing the
m in a regional or global context. We estimate the
largest movements to occur between South and West Asia, from Latin to North America, and within Africa.},
